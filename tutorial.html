<h3><b>A brief tutorial for E0102-VR</b></h3>
<br>
Although some efforts were invested into making the use of E0102-VR as straightforward as 
possible, this application remains experimental. This tutorial should help guide the users 
through some of the less intuitive aspects of the different interactions modes.<br>
<br>
You can read this now, or dive head first in the app and come back later if something 
doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>

<div id="two-column">
   <div class="tbox1">
         <h4 style="text-align: center">First thing first: load the model</h4>
         <p style="text-align:justify">
         Upon launching E0102-VR, you must enable the 3D model. To do so, point the laser beam
         to the purple button that reads "Click here to start", and pull the trigger of
         the handle "B". If you do <b>anything</b> else before this, you are on your own ...<br>
         </p>
         <h4 style="text-align: center">Click vs touch</h4>
         <p style="text-align:justify">
         There are different buttons throughout E0102-VR. These can all be "clicked" by a)
         pointing the laser beam towards them, and b) pulling the trigger on the controller
         B.<br>
         <br>
         The model parts and some other elements inside the app can be grabbed and dragged.
         To do so, the targeted part must a) be touched with the yellow  pointer attached to 
         controller B, and b) dragged as required by pulling the trigger on the same controller.

<div id="two-column">
   <div class="tbox1">
         <h4 style="text-align: center">The "parts menu"</h4>
         <p style="text-align:justify">
         Once the model has loaded, the "parts menu", attached to the controller A, 
         lists the 5 different subparts of the model: 4 iso-contours of distinct oxygen-emission
         line intensities, and the Central Compact Object. The user can show/hide this menu 
         by pushing the button labelled "parts menu" on the front of controller A.<br>
         <br>
         From this menu (using the laser beam and trigger button from the controller B),
         each model part can be shown or hidden using the ticks under the "Show?" columns. <br>
         <br>
         By touching model parts with the yellow pointer attached to the controller B, 
         the user can drag individual model parts around. To place them back in their 
         original position, the part must first be selected (by clicking the appropriate 
         white disk in the "Select?" column of the parts menu) prior to clicking the 
         "Reset selected parts" button.

<div id="two-column">
   <div class="tbox1">
         <h4 style="text-align: center">The "mode menu"</h4>
         <p style="text-align:justify">
         The users can select different interaction modes from the "mode menu", which is 
         visible on one of the wall of the interaction area. The user can show/hide this 
         menu by pushing the button labelled "mode menu" on the front of controller B.<br>
         <br>
         Selected one (or more) mode will enable specific buttons on either the controller
         A or B. Detailed pictograms detailing the buttons (and actions) associated with the
         interaction modes enabled by the user are displayed at the base of the mode menu.<br>
