<h3><b>Welcome!</b></h3>
<br>



This website (and the associated <a href="https://github.com/fpavogt/E0102-VR">Github repository</a>) is dedicated to the Virtual Reality (VR) 
application <i>E0102-VR</i>.<br> 
<br>
This application was developed between June and September 2018 at the Chilean headquarters 
of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Santiago. It was designed to <b>explore the 
potential of VR for the visualization and scientific characterization of observational datasets in astrophysics.</b><br> 
<br>
The specific scientific goal of E0102-VR is to help characterize the complex 3D structure of
the oxygen-bright ejecta in the supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219, located in the Small 
Magellanic Cloud. These ejecta correspond to the outer-layers of a massive star that exploded 
in a core-collapse supernova ~2050 years ago. During this event, the outer-layers of the 
progenitor star were expelled into space at a few 1000 km/s, giving rise to the complex 
filamentary structure we see today in this system.<br>

One key aspect of these ejecta is that they have been roughly moving ballistically (that is, 
with a constant speed) since the supernova explosion. Hence, the radial velocity of each 
ejecta knot can be translated into a physical depth. By measuring the radial
velocity of all the knots in the system with the 
<a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html">MUSE integral 
field spectrograph</a> at the Very Large Telescope, we could then assemble the 3D map of the 
ejecta: that is, the <b>real</b> 3D map of the star chunks as we see them today.<br>
<br>
Our E0102-VR application allows a complete immersion of the user inside the 3D structure. 
The interactive plot below also allows to interact with the 3D structure.
