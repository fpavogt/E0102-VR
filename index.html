This website (and the associated <a href="https://github.com/fpavogt/E0102-VR">Github repository</a>) is dedicated to the Virtual Reality (VR) 
application <i>E0102-VR</i>.<br> 
<br>
This application was developed between June and September 2018 at the Chilean headquarters 
of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Santiago. It was designed to explore the 
potential of VR for the visualization and scientific characterization of observational datasets in astrophysics.<br> 
<br>
The specific scientific goal of E0102-VR is to help characterize the complex 3D structure of
the oxygen-bright ejecta in the supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219, located in the Small 
Magellanic Cloud. These ejecta correspond to the outer-layers of a massive star that exploded 
in a core-collapse supernova ~2050 years ago. During this event, the outer-layers of the 
progenitor star were expelled into space at a few 1000 km/s, giving rise to the complex 
filamentary structure we see today in this system.<br>

One key aspect of these ejecta is that they have been roughly moving ballistically (that is, 
with a constant speed) since the supernova explosion. Using this fact, we can convert
the radial velocity of each ejecta knot into a physical depth. If you can measure the radial
velocity of all the knots, for example using the MUSE integral field spectrograph at the 
Very Large Telescope, you can then assemble a 3D map of the structure: that is, the <b>real</b>
map of the star chunks as we see them today.<br>

this image.</i><br>

Once you have this 3D map, you can then visualize it using the interactive plot below. 
Or use our E0102-VR application to fully immerse yourself in the system.
